    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A task-oriented guide for tax professionals, rebuilt from scratch for maximum detail and clarity. The structure uses a tabbed UI for "Individual" and "Business" clients. Every single tax provision has its own detailed subsection containing an "Explanation" and a detailed "Client Scenario" with numerical examples. This modular, in-depth approach ensures every item is fully explained as requested. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Report Info: All tax provisions. Goal: Inform/Explain/Apply. Viz/Method: A combination of detailed text explanations, HTML comparison tables, and specific callout boxes for client scenarios with calculations. Justification: This multi-faceted approach ensures that for every item, the user gets the "what," the "why," and the "how-to-apply" with concrete numbers.
        2. Report Info: Energy credit terminations. Goal: Warn/Advise. Viz/Method: A prominent "Action Required" table. Justification: Creates urgency and flags critical deadlines.
